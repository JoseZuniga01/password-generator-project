# started by building out the logic 
decided to use a nested function to gather all user inputs and math.random to output random integers per category 

I will use nested IF statements to test user input for accuracy 

# generatePassword function 
build entire code below in this function. When user clicks "generate password" button a series of promts will pop up asking for inputs 

# build window promt function 
use chrome's promts to ask users how long the password should be. I decided to use chrome's confim promts to reduce user error and always get a yes or no response 

# create a minum count for all input 
create a minumum count for all inputs to be used in the final password 

# create password generator 
now that I have all user inputs stored in my variables, call out those variables + my constant keys and math.random to determine waether or not to build an array for that category 

# IF statements to test user input 

to determine what the users input I creted a series of IF statements to test the variables if true or not. if true proceed to build array. 

# build a for loop 

build a for loop to get all the random characters together
